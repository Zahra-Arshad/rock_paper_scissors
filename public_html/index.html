            <h3>Rock, Paper, Scissors<br>Instructions</h3>
            <p>In rock-paper-scissors, two players will each randomly choose 
                one of three hand signs: rock (made by making a fist), paper 
                (made by laying your hand flat), or scissors (made by holding 
                out two fingers to look like scissors). Both players show their 
                signs at the same time to see who will win. Here are the rules 
                that determine which sign beats another:
                <br><br>
                Rock wins over scissors (because rock smashes scissors)<br>
                Scissors wins over paper (because scissors cut paper)<br>
                Paper wins over rock (because paper covers rock)<a href="https://www.thegamegal.com/2016/02/18/rock-paper-scissors-instructions/"><sub>Source</sub></a>
                <br><br>
                For Rock, type 1<br>
                For Paper, type 2<br>
                For Scissor, type 3
